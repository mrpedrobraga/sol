  - Huh?
  - What? Oh.
  - Look kid, I have an OBSCENE amount of paperwork to process! That's grown up business!
  - If you're lost, go look for an orphanage or something, I don't have time for this.

  [Becky]
  - S... sir?

  [Manuel]
  - Now, get lost! Go play with some... dolls or something!

  [Becky]
  - Sir!

  [Manuel]
  - Can't you see I'm getting rid of this kid that's standing ominously in the doorway?
  - What? Would we have it stand in the corner during our meeting with [important][i]The Hero of Spirit[/i][/important]?
  - It has to go perfect, Becky! Perfect!

  [Becky]
  - But, sir, this kid IS the Hero of Spirit!

	- Your name is "Manuel M. McMayor"???

	[Manuel]
	- Sure thing. Why?

	[Claire]
	- So you're a mayor... and your name is McMayor?

	[Manuel]
	- What's the confusion about?
	- I am from the prosperous McMayor family, we are proud to carry this name across generations!
	- My grandfather was a McMayor, my father was a McMayor, and now so am I!

	[Claire]
	- Oh, so you come from a family of mayors...

	[Manuel]
	- What? No, the McMayors are known for being very successful dentists.

	[Claire]
	- Your grandpa and your dad, they weren't mayors?

	[Manuel]
	- Nope.
